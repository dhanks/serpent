The pale light from the open sky pours always into this unsheltered
courtyard, together with the amber glow of standing torches. The 
dark marble temple rises like a shadow to the north, the
vivid colors of roses eastwards, and the library lies to the west.

There is a stone arch to the south. The huge, green Stone of
Sundhaven rests in the center of the courtyard, causing ripples
of magical energy to usher forth.

A jet of cool, clear water sprays endlessly from the stone.
